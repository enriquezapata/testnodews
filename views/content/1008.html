</p><p class="section-e"><b>7.3.4.5. support for Horizontal Piping</b></p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (1) </b><i>Nominally horizontal</i> piping that is inside a <i>building</i> shall be braced to prevent swaying and buckling and to control the effects of thrust.</p> <p class="subsection-e"><b>  (2) </b><i>Nominally horizontal</i> piping shall be supported so that,</p> <p class="clause-e">  (a) galvanized iron or steel pipe is supported at intervals not exceeding,</p> <p class="subclause-e">  (i) 3.75 m if the pipe <i>size</i> is 6 in. or more, and</p> <p class="subclause-e">  (ii) 2 500 mm
